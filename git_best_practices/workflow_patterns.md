# **What is Git Flow**
Git-Flow is a branching strategy that aims to cover various scenarios. It defines specific branch responsibilities, the life-cycle involves branching off from develop, integrating features, creating release branches for testing, merging into main/master, and tagging versions.

Pros:
- Well-suited for large teams and aligning work across multiple teams.
- Effective handling of multiple product versions.
- Clear responsibilities for each branch.
- Allows for easy navigation of production versions through tags.

Cons:
- Complexity due to numerous branches, potentially leading to merge conflicts.
- Development and release frequency may be slower due to multi-step process.
- Requires team consensus and commitment to adhere to the strategy.
